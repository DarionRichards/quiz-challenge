## **Description** 

In this project, I have created a dynamic web application where users answer a series of questions and stores their score after the questions have been answered. After the user has finished with the quiz, all their scores will be stored and be available to view on the highscores.html page.

## **Technologies Used** 

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Local Storage

## **User Flow**
WHEN a user clicks start button. THEN first question is randomly constructed from a array of objects AND timer starts. WHEN a user chooses an answer. THEN user is notified for a second of if answer chosen is correct or wrong AND next question is constructed. WHEN a user answers all questions. THEN timer is stopped AND form is contructed to store initials and score. WHEN a user clicks submit on the form. THEN the game is reloaded.
